Look at the [Ruby On Rails Active Record Query Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_querying.html) page 

This repo is just sample data for all the examples on that page so you can run the same examples.

## Getting started

bundle install
```

```
rails c
```

Run some of the following queries

```
Client.take
```
